# KOEA

This repository is for the KOEA python and data science study group, which meets for an hour every Saturday.
This group consists of engineers and scientists working in oil and gas industry. They are domain knowledge specialists with keen interests in Machine learning approaches to solve their problems in Geoscience. We watch online lectures and practice python programming and data science skills through examples, projects, and group discussions.

Before meetings, group members do
* read one or two chapters in our python programming textbook
* watch online lectures on EDX and/or Coursera on their own
* understand and practice previous session's examples

During our meetings, we do
* go through examples
* have discussions with other members and a session leader
